# Custom timers

This is based on [YAGPDB Countdown Example](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/reference/custom-command-examples#countdown-example-exec-cc)

- The exec command is the engine and others are just interfaces for the engine.

There are a couple of templates that have been added. If you wish to use them alter them to your needed and put in the exec CCID.
